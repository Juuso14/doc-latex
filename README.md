# Thesis template for Tel-Aviv University
A thesis latex formatted according the requirement in the Tel-Aviv University at the faculty of engineering.

This project is based on a template by Alex Liberzon that can be found in [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/master-or-ph-dot-d-thesis-template-for-tel-aviv-university-graduate-students/cknggfrwkmmg#.V0gv0Pl974Z).

Compared to Liberzon's version, this version contains correctiond and new fetures such as:

1. chapters in different tex files.
2. A new style for the title page - according to the engineering department requirements.
3. Nomenclature support
4. Arabic support
5. Defenition and Theorem style.
6. First and second supervisor.
7. With minimal channges it can be used for as Ph.D dissertation template.


Some uage notes:

1. The "main" file is the **Thesis-main.tex**.
2. Your personal information, date, supervisor can be configured in the main file.
3. every chapter should be written in a different tex file.
4. The main file describes the content order starting from "\begin{document}"
5. The main file defies all needed keywords - feel free to remove unneeded definitions.
5. Bibliography should be added in **references.bib**.
